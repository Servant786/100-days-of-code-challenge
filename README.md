## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Start Date - 19 December 2020

### Day 1: Saturday, 19 December 2020

**Today's Progress**: Checked around Github to understand how complete the log. I'm so new to Github like a child playing with a new toy.
I finally completed a section on @freeCodeCamp site for Recursion. It took me months and today decided to dedicate about an hour just trying to resolve the issue and finally, FINALLY resolved the issue. Guess what? The problem was an issue with my Google Chrome and not my solution.

**Thoughts:** I'm so new to Github like a child playing with a new toy. I may continue writing on this page don't know when I will stop. 
My thoughts sometimes go ALLL over the place. So relieved to get over that hurdle now I can move along and completed JVS on FreeCodeCamp.

**Link to work:** No link yet. will start with a link as soon as I have decided on a project. I have a few in mind but I do love the challenge and the diary. 
This is awesome.
