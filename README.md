## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Start Date - 19 December 2020

### Day 1: Saturday, 19 December 2020

**Today's Progress**: Checked around Github to understand how complete the log. I'm so new to Github like a child playing with a new toy.
I finally completed a section on @freeCodeCamp site for Recursion. It took me months and today decided to dedicate about an hour just trying to resolve the issue and finally, FINALLY resolved the issue. Guess what? The problem was an issue with my Google Chrome and not my solution.

**Thoughts:** I'm so new to Github like a child playing with a new toy. I may continue writing on this page don't know when I will stop. 
My thoughts sometimes go ALLL over the place. So relieved to get over that hurdle now I can move along and completed JVS on FreeCodeCamp.

**Link to work:** No link yet. will start with a link as soon as I have decided on a project. I have a few in mind but I do love the challenge and the diary. 
This is awesome. 

### Day 2: Sunday, 20 December 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 2: Completed another challenge @freeCodeCampHuge shout out to @ossia for creating the website, I am learning so much. Thank you Quincy Larson 
@ossia

**Thoughts:** I never realised how much of time Twitter takes up just by going through the messages and viewing the hundreds of people around the world coding. 
It's beautiful and scary.

**Link to work:** Project so far for today is on hold, just FreeCodeCamp for now, will look into continuing my project tomorrow.

### Day 3: Monday, 21 December 2020 at 10:50pm South African Time

**Today's Progress**: Day 3: A while back I found a video by Florin Pop on Youtube called how to make 10 apps in 10 hours. What a crazy challenge. I have been following each of the videos and creating my own type of app from Florin's video. Man Florin is like the David Blaine or Houdini of HTML, CSS and JVS. He breaks down everthing and shares his thoughts on how he creates his apps. Thank you @FlorinPop

**Thoughts:** I added my thoughts in the above but I am on the GitHub Profile App. Stuck with an error I received and have been trying to fix this for about 30 minutes.

**Link to work:** Not sure how to link the project yet, will check that out tomorrow. Thanks Github for this and Kallaway for starting this 100DaysOFCoding. I am really enjoying this.

### Day 4: Tuesday, 22 December 2020 at 10:24pm South African Time

**Today's Progress**: Day 4: Just completed the Github Portfolio Project by Florin Pop. I still have a few tweaks to complete but it was good. I am also on 96% on my JVS on FreeCodeCamp Progress. 

**Thoughts:** Its not easy to follow an expert like Florin and learn. Although you can however if you are beginnner you need understand the concepts before deep diving into the big stuff. Feels like you driving in reverse while everybody else is going forward. Not doing much justice with FreeCodeCamp, just looking to complete the course and move along. Hate that feeling. Nothing wrong with the content. Decided to go into CodeCademy and check out if I can refresh myself with Javascript. One day forward 2 steps back.

**Link to work:** Not sure how to link the project yet. Thanks Github for this and Kallaway for starting this 100DaysOFCoding. I am really enjoying this.

### Day 5: Wednesday, 23 December 2020 at 10:16pm South African Time

**Today's Progress**: Day 5: Completed Basic JavaScript Course on FreeCodeCamp. Now on to ES6 Challenges.......

**Thoughts:** Onward to the next level, feels like I'm moving rather slowly, but thank god I have this Day to Day progress to keep me level headed. I'm sure after 100 days I'll be looking back at some of these comments and saying to myself what in the world was I thinking when I wrote that.

**Link to work:** Not sure how to link the project yet. not going to lie either haven't gotten around to even trying.
