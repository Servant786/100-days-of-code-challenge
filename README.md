### Day 1: Saturday, 19 December 2020

**Today's Progress**: Checked around Github to understand how complete the log. I'm so new to Github like a child playing with a new toy.

**Thoughts:** I'm so new to Github like a child playing with a new toy. I may continue writing on this page don't know when I will stop. 
My thoughts sometimes go ALLL over the place.

**Link to work:** No link yet. will start with a link as soon as I have decided on a project. I have a few in mind but I do love the challenge and the diary. 
This is awesome.
